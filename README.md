# Genshin Daily Check-in

Try using the defults for everything and see if it works first, I think it will.

Windows will probably give a pop-up when you try starting the program the first time saying somthing about unknown developer. If you aren't sure my program is safe then look through the code [here](https://github.com/runningwinterberry/Genshin-Daily-Check-in/blob/master/Genshin_Daily_Check-in.py "https://github.com/runningwinterberry/Genshin-Daily-Check-in/blob/master/Genshin_Daily_Check-in.py"). Else, click the "more info"(I think) button then click Run Anyway.

If the defult rgb doesn't work for you, you will need to enter the rgb value for the orange on the little rectangles you click on when collecting your daily rewards.
you can get the rgb value by using the eyedropper tool(thats what its called on firefox anyway, there should be plenty of addons to get colors at the verry least)
if whatever you use gives a hex color use an rgb-hex converter to convert it.

![Where to get the color from](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107645847/174152813-8c626181-250c-4ea2-af24-5dbc7d1b9db3.png)

### Mac and Linux Users

No idea if this will work for you. If it doesn't work you could take a video or screenshot of the readout and post it in Issues.
