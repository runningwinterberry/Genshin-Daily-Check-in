# Genshin Daily Check-in

If the defult rgb doesn't work for you, you will need to enter the rgb value for the orange on the little rectangles you click on when collecting your daily rewards.
you can get the rgb value by using the eyedropper tool(thats what its called on firefox anyway, there should be plenty of addons to get colors at the verry least)
if whatever you use gives a hex color use an rgb-hex converter to convert it.

### Mac and Linux Users

No idea if this will work for you. If it doesn't work you could take a video or screenshot of the readout and post it in Issues.
